      <p>
        History isn’t just a list of dates and battles—it’s a doorway into the
        richness of human experience. What I enjoy most is uncovering the
        traditions, food, and fashion that reveal how different cultures
        celebrated life, mourned loss, and made sense of the world. From ancient
        Koreans to nomadic tribes, these stories highlight the creativity and
        resilience of people across time. For me, history is both inspiring and
        eye-opening—a subject that connects the past to the world we live in
        today.
